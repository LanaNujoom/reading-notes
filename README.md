# Growth Mindest 
It is a state of being which makes people think positively, as they say look at the filled side of the cup.
*Growth Mindest* is about seeing the advantages of difficalities and converting challenges to oppurtunities. 
People with a growth mindset believe that skills, knowledge and creativity can all grow with time and experience.
# How to Keep Yourself in a Growth Mindest?
- Focus on the result you want to achieve , whatever others tell you or try to frustrate you.
- Remember there are always obstacles, but you can overcome them.
- Always make effort to learn but do not forget to have fun too.
