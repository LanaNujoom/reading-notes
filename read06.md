## Dynamic Web Pages with Javascripts 

The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to **load the JavaScript file ** (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file)

- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file.

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. 

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,strings, and true or false values known as **Booleans**.
