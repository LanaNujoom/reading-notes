# What we have learned :

## Git hub commands:

- ls = list

- cd = change directory 

- pwd = print working direct 

- Tree = whole directory of the device visualised 

- cd.. = previous directory

- ls-l = detailed directory

- mkdir = creat folder 

- touch = creats file

- code . = opens VS

- clear = deletes log


**Git helps edit your main project by cloning it then merging without changing the main image**
