# What I Have Learned :

## Declaring Function

give it a ***name*** then write the statement needed

## Calling a Function

Execute all the statements between its ** curly braces ** with one line of code.


- We start Our Javascripts by adding it in the bottom of the code inside html file 
  
  - Prefer to create a new file which is ***.js*** to add javascripts inside it and then ***link it with html page***
  
  - consloe.log just seen in the console when we open the inspect and nothing in it will be rendered.
